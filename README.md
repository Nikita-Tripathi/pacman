#Development of the following program is incomplete, only a usable text-based version for Demo 2

# Pacman
Pacman is a collection of classes that work together to make a recreation of the popular arcade game PACMAN.

## Description
This version is only text-based and takes input from the user one turn at a time.
The input is expected in the following forms to indicate the direction they want the avatar to move in:
  u for up, d for down, r for right, l for left
The goal of the user is to collect coins and power ups (which reward points) without running into the only ghost present in the game.
The game is won if the user achieves the over 750 points or more. The game is lost if the user takes more than 50 moves to win the game or the pacman is eaten by the ghost 3 times.
There are total three lives/chances provided to the user

## Installation
Download the java files in the same folder:
  Brain.java
  Ghost.java
  World.java
  Pacman.java
The game can be run by compiling the Brain.java class in the console and then running Brain.
